The src/ folder is used as a patch to cover go/src/,
once patched, the go is able to cross-compile with the following steps:

  (1) patch src/ into go/src/
  (2) when compile compiler:
		cd go/src/
		./all.bash
		export GOOS=ucore
		export GOROOT=(go's parent folder)/go
		export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
		cd go/src/pkg/runtime/
		make clean
		make install
  (3) when compile go file:
		8g hello.go
		8l -a hello.8 > hello.s
